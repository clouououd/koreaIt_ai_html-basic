      Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
      through some interesting places on the way: 
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla,</li>
            <li>WA, Magic City, </li>
            <li>ID, Bountiful, </li>
            <li>UT, </li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO,</li>
        </ol>
        Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the
        road today: 
        <blockquote>
            "Passing cars,<br>
            When you can't see,<br>
            May get you,<br>
            A glimpse, Of eternity.
        </blockquote>
        " I definitely won't be passing 
        any cars.
    </p>

    <p>
        My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
        everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
        I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone</li>
            <li>iPod</li>
            <li>digital camera</li>
            <li>a protein bar</li>
        </ul>
        Just the essentials.  AsLao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
